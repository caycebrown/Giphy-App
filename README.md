This respository is for a web application that will demonstrate the use of Ajax requests to utilize
API's and their respective JSON data. The API utilized will be from Giphy, and the JSON data will be used to append GIFs to 
the webpage that are based on a user-provided search term. It will also create buttons for each input to create quick access
back to the results of each search.
